.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a BIP 39 Bitcoin seed phrase generator which is intended to be
portable and auditable, with minimal dependencies and easy-to-read
source code.
The intended use case is seed phrase generation on an airgap machine.
To protect safety of user funds, a battery of standard test vectors is
run on every use.
.Pp
A seed is read off the system random device; and corresponding
seed words are printed to standard output.
.Pp
In general usage, the options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl d Ar argument"
.It Fl b Ar bits
Generate a mnemonic phrase representing a seed with
.Ar bits
bits.
Valid values for
.Ar bits
and the word length they produce are as follows:

.TE
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Read key material in the form of binary octets from the specified
.Ar keyfile .
.Sy The actual length of keymat provided must match the specified number of bits.
Use
.Pa "-"
to specify standard input.
.It Fl l Ar lang
Produce a mnemonic in the language or writing system
.Ar lang .
The language may be specified via various identifiers as listed by the
.Fl L
option.
In alphabetical order, currently supported languages and writing systems are
Chinese
.Pq Simplified ,
Chinese
.Pq Traditional ,
English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish.
The default language is English.

The following modes do not produce a mnemonic phrase:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl d Ar argument"
.It Fl L
List languages and writing systems which may be used with the
.Fl l Ar lang
option, then exit.
Any of the listed strings may be used as an identifier.
.It Fl P
Print the wordlist to stdout in the source format used at build time,
and print the SHA-256 hash of the wordlist to stderr; then exit.
.It Fl T
Run a full battery of self-tests with verbose results printed to stdout,
then exit.
An abbreviated self-test is run each and every time the
.Nm
utility is used.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Generate a 24-word mnemonic representing a 256-bit random seed:
.Pp
.Dl "umask 077"
.Dl "easyseed -b 256 > myseed.txt"
.Pp
Generate an 18-word mnemonic in the Japanese language,
representing a 192-bit random seed:
.Pp
.Dl "easyseed -b 192 -l japanese"
.Pp
Use bits from a keyfile:
.Dl "dd if=/dev/random of=secret.key bs=32 count=1"
.Dl "easyseed -b 256 -k secret.key > myseed.txt"
or
.Dl "easyseed -b 256 -k - < secret.key > myseed.txt"

.Sh CAVEATS
Most users are apparently still generating airgap seed phrases with
Javascript-based seed phrase generators.
Adequate random number generation is impossible from within Javascript.
Users should use the
.Nm
utility instead.
.Sh BUGS
Language support is necessarily finite.
The
.Nm
utility supports all languages which have official BIP 39
wordlists in the Bitcoin BIP repository.
To add your language to the
.Nm
utility, add a wordlist for your language to the BIP 39 wordlist set.
.Pp
The author monkey-pasted language names from a popular wiki site.
If the
.Fl L
option shows an incorrect name for your language,
.Em in
your language, then please file a bug or contact the author.
.Pp
The short identifiers for the two distinct Chinese writing systems are
suboptimal, and inconsistent with reality.
Better suggestions would be appreciated.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
For secure seed phrase generation, it is imperative to use an adequate
CSPRNG as a source of randomness.
The
.Nm
utility draws randomness off the system
.Ap
s
.Xr random 4
device.
To avoid blocking on Linux,
.Nm
reads off
.Pa /dev/urandom .
The author deems this to be adequate.
On other reasonable systems, such as FreeBSD,
.Pa /dev/urandom
is a symlink to
.Pa /dev/random ;
thus, this is a non-issue.
.Pp
.Nm
performs basic sanitization to zeroize and remove keymat (key material)
from memory.
It also uses
.Xr write 2
to output the seed phrase, so as to avoid any userland buffering in
.Xr printf 3 .
However, this does nothing to prevent secret bits from being left
in the memory areas used by the kernel for file or pipe buffers.
.Pp
In proper use on a dedicated airgap machine, this should be of
lesser concern than on a multiuser and/or networked system.
.Nm
will leave far less data remanence than most other software which
deals with secret keys.
Also,
.Nm
is far superior to utilities written in Javascript and similar,
which have absolutely no control of garbage collection and memory release.
