EASYSEED(1)                 General Commands Manual                EASYSEED(1)

NAME
     easyseed – Bitcoin BIP 39 mnemonic seed phrase generator

SYNOPSIS
     easyseed -b bits [-k keyfile]

DESCRIPTION
     easyseed is a BIP 39 Bitcoin seed phrase generator which is intended to
     be portable and auditable, with minimal dependencies and easy-to-read
     source code.  The intended use case is seed phrase generation on an
     airgap machine.  To protect safety of user funds, a battery of standard
     test vectors is run on every use.

     A seed is read off the system random device; and corresponding seed words
     are printed to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -b bits            Generate a mnemonic phrase representing a seed with
                        bits bits.  Valid values for bits and the word length
                        they produce are as follows:

                        Bits   Words
                        128     12
                        160     15
                        192     18
                        224     21
                        256     24

     -k keyfile         Read key material in the form of binary octets from
                        the specified keyfile.  The actual length of keymat
                        provided must match the specified number of bits. Use
                        - to specify standard input.

EXIT STATUS
     The easyseed utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Generate a 24-word mnemonic representing a 256-bit random seed:

           umask 077
           easyseed -b 256 > myseed.txt

     Use bits from a keyfile:
           dd if=/dev/random of=secret.key bs=32 count=1
           easyseed -b 256 -k secret.key > myseed.txt
     or
           easyseed -b 256 -k - < secret.key > myseed.txt

STANDARDS
     The easyseed utility conforms to Bitcoin BIP 39:

CAVEATS
     Most users are apparently still generating airgap seed phrases with
     Javascript-based seed phrase generators.  Adequate random number
     generation is impossible from within Javascript.  Users should use the
     easyseed utility instead.

BUGS
     Thus far, only English-language seed phrases are supported.  A future
     version will add support for all languages which have official wordlists
     in the Bitcoin BIP repository.  To add your language to the easyseed
     utility, add a wordlist for your language to the BIP 39 wordlist set.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     For secure seed phrase generation, it is imperative to use an adequate
     CSPRNG as a source of randomness.  The easyseed utility draws randomness
     off the system's random(4) device.  To avoid blocking on Linux, easyseed
     reads off /dev/urandom.  The author deems this to be adequate.  On other
     reasonable systems, such as FreeBSD, /dev/urandom is a symlink to
     /dev/random; thus, this is a non-issue.

     easyseed performs basic sanitization to zeroize and remove keymat (key
     material) from memory.  It also uses write(2) to output the seed phrase,
     so as to avoid any userland buffering in printf(3).  However, this does
     nothing to prevent secret bits from being left in the memory areas used
     by the kernel for file or pipe buffers.

     In proper use on a dedicated airgap machine, this should be of lesser
     concern than on a multiuser and/or networked system.  easyseed will leave
     far less data remanence than most other software which deals with secret
     keys.  Also, easyseed is far superior to utilities written in Javascript
     and similar, which have absolutely no control of garbage collection and
     memory release.
