DESCRIPTION
     easyseed is a BIP 39 Bitcoin seed phrase generator which is intended to
     be portable and auditable, with minimal dependencies and easy-to-read
     source code.  The intended use case is seed phrase generation on an
     airgap machine.  To protect safety of user funds, a battery of standard
     test vectors is run on every use.

     A seed is read off the system random device; and corresponding seed words
     are printed to standard output.

     In general usage, the options are as follows:

     -b bits            Generate a mnemonic phrase representing a seed with
                        bits bits.  Valid values for bits and the word length
                        they produce are as follows:

                        Bits   Words
                        128     12
                        160     15
                        192     18
                        224     21
                        256     24

     -k keyfile         Read key material in the form of binary octets from
                        the specified keyfile.  The actual length of keymat
                        provided must match the specified number of bits. Use
                        - to specify standard input.

     -l lang            Produce a mnemonic in the language or writing system
                        lang.  The language may be specified via various
                        identifiers as listed by the -L option.  In
                        alphabetical order, currently supported languages and
                        writing systems are Chinese (Simplified), Chinese
                        (Traditional), English, French, Italian, Japanese,
                        Korean, and Spanish.  The default language is English.

     The following modes do not produce a mnemonic phrase:

     -L                 List languages and writing systems which may be used
                        with the -l lang option, then exit.  Any of the listed
                        strings may be used as an identifier.

     -P                 Print the wordlist to stdout in the source format used
                        at build time, and print the SHA-256 hash of the
                        wordlist to stderr; then exit.

     -T                 Run a full battery of self-tests with verbose results
                        printed to stdout, then exit.  An abbreviated self-
                        test is run each and every time the easyseed utility
                        is used.

EXIT STATUS
     The easyseed utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Generate a 24-word mnemonic representing a 256-bit random seed:

           umask 077
           easyseed -b 256 > myseed.txt

     Generate an 18-word mnemonic in the Japanese language, representing a
     192-bit random seed:

           easyseed -b 192 -l japanese

     Use bits from a keyfile:
           dd if=/dev/random of=secret.key bs=32 count=1
           easyseed -b 256 -k secret.key > myseed.txt
     or
           easyseed -b 256 -k - < secret.key > myseed.txt

CAVEATS
     Most users are apparently still generating airgap seed phrases with
     Javascript-based seed phrase generators.  Adequate random number
     generation is impossible from within Javascript.  Users should use the
     easyseed utility instead.

BUGS
     Language support is necessarily finite.  The easyseed utility supports
     all languages which have official BIP 39 wordlists in the Bitcoin BIP
     repository.  To add your language to the easyseed utility, add a wordlist
     for your language to the BIP 39 wordlist set.

     The author monkey-pasted language names from a popular wiki site.  If the
     -L option shows an incorrect name for your language, in your language,
     then please file a bug or contact the author.

     The short identifiers for the two distinct Chinese writing systems are
     suboptimal, and inconsistent with reality.  Better suggestions would be
     appreciated.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     For secure seed phrase generation, it is imperative to use an adequate
     CSPRNG as a source of randomness.  The easyseed utility draws randomness
     off the system's random(4) device.  To avoid blocking on Linux, easyseed
     reads off /dev/urandom.  The author deems this to be adequate.  On other
     reasonable systems, such as FreeBSD, /dev/urandom is a symlink to
     /dev/random; thus, this is a non-issue.

     easyseed performs basic sanitization to zeroize and remove keymat (key
     material) from memory.  It also uses write(2) to output the seed phrase,
     so as to avoid any userland buffering in printf(3).  However, this does
     nothing to prevent secret bits from being left in the memory areas used
     by the kernel for file or pipe buffers.

     In proper use on a dedicated airgap machine, this should be of lesser
     concern than on a multiuser and/or networked system.  easyseed will leave
     far less data remanence than most other software which deals with secret
     keys.  Also, easyseed is far superior to utilities written in Javascript
     and similar, which have absolutely no control of garbage collection and
     memory release.
